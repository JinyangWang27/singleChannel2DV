# singleChannel2DV

A width-averaged single channel model to simulate the water motion.

The code solves for external M2 tide. Tidal rectification due to momentum advection, velocity-depth asymmetry, and Stokes return flow.

# ResidualVertical

An interactive 1D column model for visualise the effects of various parameter on the flow vertical structure.
